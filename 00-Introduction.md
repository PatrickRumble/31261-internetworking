# Introduction to Cybersecurity Labs

Welcome to your interactive cybersecurity learning environment.  
This virtual machine (VM) has been designed to give you hands-on practice with common security vulnerabilities and attack techniques, based on the OWASP Top 10.

## How to Use
1. Work through each lab in numerical order (01, 02, 03…).
2. Read the `README.md` in each folder before starting.
3. Try to solve the challenge before checking the `solutions/` folder.
4. Use the **Resources** folder for tool references and cheatsheets.
5. If you get stuck, don’t worry — the learning comes from exploring and failing first.

## Disclaimer
These labs are for **educational purposes only**.  
Do not use the techniques outside of this VM environment. Misuse of these tools outside a safe lab environment may be **illegal**.
