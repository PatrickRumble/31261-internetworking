## Nmap
**Purpose:** Network discovery and service enumeration.  
**Educational Use:** Students will scan the Linux and Windows VMs to identify open ports, services, and potential entry points.  
**Real-World Relevance:** Nmap is used by security professionals to map network environments before penetration testing. Understanding port scanning helps students recognize how attackers gather reconnaissance information.

## Hydra
**Purpose:** Password cracking via brute force.  
**Educational Use:** Students will test weak credentials on SSH or web logins to understand attack mechanics.  
**Real-World Relevance:** Demonstrates the dangers of weak passwords. Organizations that ignore password hygiene are vulnerable to account compromise, data theft, and ransomware.

## SQLMap
**Purpose:** Automated SQL injection testing.  
**Educational Use:** Students will perform SQL injection attacks against the Linux VM to retrieve database information.  
**Real-World Relevance:** Highlights the importance of input validation and secure coding. SQL injection is a common attack vector in the wild, often exploited to exfiltrate sensitive data.

## Metasploit Framework (Optional)
**Purpose:** Exploit development and penetration testing framework.  
**Educational Use:** Students can simulate attacks in a controlled environment, understanding how vulnerabilities are exploited.  
**Real-World Relevance:** Widely used in professional penetration testing. Provides insight into attacker methodologies and helps defenders plan mitigation strategies.

## Wireshark
**Purpose:** Network packet capture and analysis.  
**Educational Use:** Students can inspect traffic to observe attack payloads and understand network communication.  
**Real-World Relevance:** Critical for network security monitoring, forensic investigations, and detecting suspicious activity.
