# Kali Linux Attacker VM Overview

The Kali attacker VM represents the offensive perspective in this lab environment. It is pre-loaded with popular penetration testing tools to simulate real-world attacks and educate students on how attackers operate.

## Purpose
The goal of this VM is to teach students:
- How vulnerabilities are discovered and exploited
- The practical use of penetration testing tools
- How to think like an attacker to improve defensive strategies

## Structure
The Kali VM contains:
- Pre-installed tools such as Hydra, SQLMap, and Nmap
- Directories for lab exercises, including README files and notes
- Guidance for safe and ethical use of tools in the lab environment

## Real-World Relevance
Knowledge of attacker tools is essential for security professionals. By learning the techniques attackers use, students can design better defenses and mitigation strategies. This VM simulates real-world penetration testing workflows without risking production systems.

## Learning Outcomes
Students will:
1. Learn to navigate Kali Linux and use basic commands.
2. Understand the role of attacker tools in penetration testing.
3. Gain insight into offensive techniques while respecting ethical boundaries.
