# Introduction to Cybersecurity Labs

Welcome to your interactive cybersecurity learning environment.  
This project provides a safe space to explore and exploit common security vulnerabilities without real-world risk.

## How the Labs Work
- The environment consists of three VMs:  
  - **Linux Target (01)** – intentionally vulnerable server-side applications.  
  - **Windows Target (02)** – misconfigurations and insecure user practices.  
  - **Kali Attacker (03)** – penetration testing distribution with preinstalled tools.  

- You will use the **Kali VM throughout all labs** to attack the Linux and Windows machines.  
- The Kali lab (03) is structured as a **tool reference guide**. It does not need to be completed last — instead, use it alongside the other labs whenever you need to learn about or practice with a tool.

## Recommended Lab Order
1. Read this introduction.  
2. Complete the **Linux VM lab (01)**.  
3. Complete the **Windows VM lab (02)**.  
4. Use the **Kali Attacker lab (03)** as a reference whenever tools are required.  

## Disclaimer
These labs are for **educational purposes only**.  
Do not use the techniques outside of this VM environment. Misuse of these tools outside a safe lab environment may be **illegal**.
