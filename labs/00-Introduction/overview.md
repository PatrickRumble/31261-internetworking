# Introduction to the Cybersecurity Lab Environment

Welcome to your interactive cybersecurity learning environment. This VM-based environment is designed to give students hands-on experience with common cybersecurity vulnerabilities, defensive techniques, and the use of penetration testing tools in a safe and controlled manner.

## Purpose
The goal of this lab environment is to bridge the gap between theory and practice in cybersecurity education. By working in isolated virtual machines, students can explore vulnerabilities, practice exploitation, and learn how to remediate issues without risk to real-world systems.

## Structure
- **Labs:** The environment contains three core VMs: Linux target, Windows target, and Kali attacker.
- **Guided Learning:** Each lab contains structured exercises with overviews, theoretical background, and practical instructions.
- **Safety:** All activities are contained within the VMs and should never be attempted outside this environment.

## Real-World Relevance
Understanding how vulnerabilities appear in controlled environments prepares students for practical security work. The lab encourages a defensive mindset by showing how attackers exploit weaknesses and how mitigation strategies can be applied.

## Learning Outcomes
By completing the introduction lab, students will:
1. Understand the purpose of each VM in the environment.
2. Become familiar with the folder and file structure for labs.
3. Learn how to navigate the lab safely and effectively.
4. Understand the objectives of future labs and the skills they will build.
