# Windows Target VM Overview

The Windows target VM is designed to provide an approachable introduction to common security flaws in Windows-based systems. The VM emphasises accessibility and simplicity while covering fundamental vulnerabilities that are often seen in enterprise environments.

## Purpose
Students will focus on understanding and exploiting vulnerabilities such as:

- Insecure authentication & weak passwords
- Poorly configured web applications
- Insufficient logging and monitoring

## Structure
The Windows VM includes:
- A base Windows image with intentionally insecure services
- Guided exercises to illustrate each vulnerability
- Background information in `vulnerabilities.md` and step-by-step instructions in `instructions.md`

## Real-World Relevance
Many organisational breaches originate from weak credentials, poorly configured servers, or missing monitoring. Understanding these vulnerabilities helps students grasp the importance of secure configuration, auditing, and proactive monitoring in Windows environments.

## Learning Outcomes
After completing this lab, students will:
1. Understand common Windows system misconfigurations.
2. Explore exploitation techniques in a controlled environment.
3. Learn methods to remediate and secure systems.
4. Appreciate the importance of logging and monitoring in Windows security.
