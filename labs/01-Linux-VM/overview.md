# Linux Target VM Overview

The Linux target VM is designed to demonstrate common server-side vulnerabilities in a Linux environment. It provides a safe platform for students to practice identifying, exploiting, and mitigating vulnerabilities in web applications and network services.

## Purpose
This lab focuses on server misconfigurations and security flaws that are frequently encountered in real-world Linux systems. Students will gain practical experience in:

- Exploiting web application vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, file upload flaws)
- Performing brute-force attacks on weak credentials
- Understanding attack vectors and defensive measures

## Structure
The Linux VM is pre-configured with:
- Vulnerable web applications
- Weak SSH credentials for brute-force exercises
- Step-by-step guidance for each lab exercise (instructions to be completed in `instructions.md`)

## Real-World Relevance
Linux servers are widely used in enterprise and web hosting environments. Exploits like SQL injection and insecure file uploads have led to data breaches, website defacement, and malware deployment. By practicing in this VM, students gain insight into secure coding practices and hardening strategies.

## Learning Outcomes
By completing the Linux VM lab, students will:
1. Identify vulnerabilities in web applications and network services.
2. Understand the techniques used to exploit these vulnerabilities.
3. Learn best practices for securing Linux servers.
4. Build confidence in hands-on offensive and defensive cybersecurity skills.
